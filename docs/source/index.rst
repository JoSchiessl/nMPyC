Welcome to nMPyC's documentation!
===================================

**nMPyC** is a Python library for solving optimal control problems via model predictive control (MPC).

**nMPyC** can be understood as a blackbox method. The user can only enter the desired optimal control problem without having much knowledge of the theory of model predictive control or its implementation in Python. Nevertheless, for an advanced user, there is the possibility to adjust all parameters.

This library supports a variety of discretization methods and optimizers including `CasADi <https://web.casadi.org/>`_ and `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_ solvers.
