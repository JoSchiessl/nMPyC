Welcome to nMPyC's documentation!
===================================

**nMPyC** is a Python library for solving optimal control problems via model predictive control (MPC).

This Python toolbox should be understood as a blackbox method.
Our goal is to enable the user to enter his problem as easily as possible and to deliver results without having to have much prior knowledge of model predictive control and its implementation in Python.

In addition, our toolbox supports a variety of discretization methods and optimizers including `CasADi <https://web.casadi.org/>`_ and `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_ solvers.

   This project is under active development.
